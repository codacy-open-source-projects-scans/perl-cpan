Recently there was a patch that broke some module by Gisle from which
there were many dependencies and I had smoke and asked for backing it
out.

The patch was referenced as 30672 and 30762 (it really was: 30762 AND
30763) and the module was GAAS/HTML-Parser-3.56.tar.gz. They were
backed out with 30776.

The thread was during 2007-03-[26..29].

Todo: write a test case that fails without needing HTML::Parser.
